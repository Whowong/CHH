## 2. Chat & Codebase Answers
### Goal: Understand how chat interacts with the indexed codebase.

1. Open the **Chat side window** using `Ctrl + I`.
2. Ensure you are on the **Chat** tab (not **Composer** or **Bug**).
3. Ask: **"What does this app do?"** and compare:
   - **Press Enter** â†’ Provides a general response.
   - **Press Ctrl + Enter** â†’ Uses the indexed codebase for a more precise answer.
4. **Best practice**: Keep all files closed while testing for a clear comparison.

## 3. Referencing Documentation
### Goal: Use indexed documentation for more accurate responses.

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon on the top right).
2. Navigate to the **Features** section.
3. Scroll down to **Docs** and click **Add new doc**.
4. Enter a name (e.g., **Bicep**) and press **Enter**.
5. Now, test the difference:
   - Ask: **"How do I use the Bicep Kubernetes extension?"**
     - The response might be outdated as the model was trained on **Oct 2023** data.
   - Now, try: **"@Bicep How do I use the Bicep Kubernetes extension?"**
     - This will provide updated instructions based on indexed documentation.
